# serverless-to-do-list

This is a single list that contains many items [To do List](https://mattkwondo.github.io/to-do-list/index.html)
- When an item is clicked it will be striked out
- It will allow the addition of new items
- It will allow the deletion of items

## Approach taken in building it

- It will be based on html, css, and javascript.
- It will not have a server, so data will not be persisted over sessions.


## User stories
- As a user, I want to create a to do list with many items
- As a user, I want to add, check off, and delete items from the list

## Dependencies

Install with `npm install`.

-   [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io)
-   [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com)
-   [Handlebars.js](http://handlebarsjs.com)

At the beginning of each cohort, update the versions in
[`package.json`](package.json) by replace all versions with a glob (`*`) and
running `npm update --save && npm update --save-dev`. You may wish to test these
changes by deleting the `node_modules` directory and running `npm install`.
Fix any conflicts.

## Tasks

Developers should run these often!

-   `grunt nag` or just `grunt`: runs code quality analysis tools on your code
    and complains
-   `grunt reformat`: reformats all your code in a standard style
-   `grunt <server|serve|s>`: generates bundles, watches, and livereloads
-   `grunt test`: runs any automated tests, depends on `grunt build`
-   `grunt build`: place bundled styles and scripts where `index.html` can find
    them
